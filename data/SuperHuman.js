        plainText: "With digitalisation development, digital products emerge and invade our lives, reshaping our understanding of “product”. In the previous Re:Vision project, I tried to expand the human perceptual ability through interactive means. Now, I hope to explore the relationship between humans and machines by thinking about humans and machines' future to propose a new definition of interaction for the next generation of products: What is the direction of future products, and how could the human-computer interaction progress?"

        plainText: "The miniaturisation and intelligence made mobility the essential demand for traditional products; smartphones have become an indispensable part of daily life. In the speculative design, machines are gradually deviating from the pure tools of human, but moving toward coexistence. Artificial organs, bones are the primary manifestation of this trend, and contemporary smartphones, watches, and even smart clothing are externalising this trend. To demonstrate the characteristics of this coexistence relationship, the prostheses, that opposite to the structure of the human body, are being illustrated; like artificial organs such as artificial hearts, the prostheses replace and enhance normal limbs' functions. The purpose of illustration of the prostheses are not to satisfy the basic needs of the disabled, but to reflect the future relationship between humans and machines - In the context of future wearable devices, The product is no longer a tool to meet particular needs, but one of our essential organs."

While humans and machines are more closely developing to meet the core goal of symbiosis, efficient and intuitive interactive methods are put forward. I illustrate the interactive elements that no longer following flat patterns but completely 3D dynamic elements based on VR's three-dimensional interface. In terms of interactive means, hands or fingers are completely abandoned, and the rotation of the eyeball and head is used as a new interactive language."
