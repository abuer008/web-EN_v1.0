        plainText: 'Europe has one of the highest shares of elderly people in the world. In 2016, already 19% of the European population1 was 65 years and over. Looking at the prognoses, this share will increase to 29% by 2070; meaning that more than 1 in 4 people in Europe will be 65 years or over. As people grow older, it is expected that there will be more people with age-related chronic diseases and in need of long-term care.',
        plainText2: 'Changing family structures and the growing participation of women in the labour market put the reliance on informal caregivers at risk. In addition, providing care to kin can be burdening and negatively affect the informal caregivers\' health and well- being. Formal care organisations also suffer from a shrinking workforce and major budget cuts, thereby endangering the access and quality of care and putting even more pressure on informal caregivers.'

        plainText: "Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a research paradigm that brings intelligence to everyday environments through sensor networks, pervasive computing and artificial intelligence. This way, our environments become sensitive, adaptive and responsive to our presence and needs.",
        plainText2: "AAL applies the classic principles of Ambient Intelligence to a new generation of assistive technologies for older adults, which are embedded (i.e., non-invasive and unobtrusively integrated into the environment); context-aware (i.e., recognise the user and the situational context); personalised (i.e., tailored to the specific needs of the individual user); adaptive (i.e., responsive to the user through learning); and anticipatory (i.e., anticipating the userâ€™s needs and desires without conscious mediation). In AAL, ambient intelligence is used to create supportive environments that provide all-encompassing, non-invasive and pro-active assistance to the user."
