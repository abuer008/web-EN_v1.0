        plainText: "Visible light waves (vision), temperature (haptic), chemical molecules (taste) and other phenomena we can see or perceive are actually a tiny part of the real world. In real life, much information goes unnoticed and cannot be perceived because of humans' limitation of senses. Intelligent machine cognition helps us describe the environmental world in a novel way, and can be translated into an understandable language for people to read."

    hapticStimuli: {
        heading: "Single row of haptic stimuli",
        plainText: "Conveying unnecessary information about the environment can lead to a risk of sensory overload. The spatial position and the shape of objects can be represented like our visual perception with only a few stimuli in one row taking into account the limited change in the magnitude."

        heading: "Data translation",
        plainText: "For representing such quantity of visual data, three distinct factors have to be condition and notice: 1. The changes of direction, that what are user-facing (head rotation). 2. The changes of position, that where is user standing. 3. The changes in each signal intensity at a certain moment. Like the animations on the left illustrated, the grid shapes express the sections toward the camera system, and each section connects with each stimulus in the round shape.",
        plainText2: "After long-term training, subtle variations of signal intensity can even indicate differences in different objects' shape. At the moment of contact between the target and the perceivable range of the prototype, the change of signal intensity and the velocity of change in each point can discern the difference from shapes of the target."

    prototype: {
        heading: "First Prototype",
        plainText: "As an initial point, the system based on a Kinect camera for gathering the visual data is presented. The camera emitted thousands of invisible infrared rays to calculate objects' area at a certain distance. The environment towards the camera has diverted into multiple sections in the monitor. The collision of infrared rays in the different section would be activating different LED, depends on the number of the collisions the intensities of LEDs can also change autonomously.",
        plainText2: "The generator of tactile signals was designed to simulate the press stimuli using hub magnet, which was more accurate and similar to electrical stimulation. The Kinect motion sensor and the input simulation to head-mounted prototype can be attached to the head; the hub magnets, that on the annular housing mounted, can generate the stimuli and convey to the forehead."

    conclusion: {
        heading: "Perceptual substitution",
        plainText: "Such as shapes, colours, etc., the subjective description of objects, are actually a perceptual language of our brain. Inspired by that this project designs a prototype, that represents visual information into tactile language. The successful visual substitution proves that the natural sensory organs' information can be perceived in another form through manual intervention.",
        plainText2: "Machine cognition, artificial intelligence, the common research topics in recent years, show us how people’s daily lives would be like, the interaction between people and machines, and the external world becomes more complex. This project aims to propose a possibility: haptic as a kind of “low-res” perceptual language, can be described such quantity of information like vision. It can also be used as a new channel of the senses, using artificial sensors expand perception in humans."
